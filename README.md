To execute the notebooks, it is necessary to update the folder paths where indicated.

## Short description of the notebooks

**pes_behavior:** Behavoral data analysis

**pes_classifiers:** Single-cell neural data analysis with logistic regression

**pes_demixing:** Neural data analysis of simultaneously recorded neurons

**pes_firing_rates:** Converts spiketrains to firing rates

**pes_sess_to_probes:** Links experimental sessions to probes and cell ID-s

**pes_shuffling:** Single-cell neural data analysis with the permutation test

**pes_spikes:** Extracts spiketrains from the IBL dataset
